========

OpenFOAM extension for the combustion of an energetic material using the
volume of fluids (VOF-PLIC) and immersed boundary approach.

Test Cases
--------------------------

### testPyro1

A quasi-1D surface regression test case on a hex mesh.

### testPyro2

A quasi-1D surface regression test case on a tet mesh. Performs rather poorly.

### testPyro3

A 2D test case with a 2 cm diameter cylinder in a 1 m/s cross-flow
(Re ~ 1400) with a constant conversion mass flux.
